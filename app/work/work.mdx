### Lambdus

I took a year off school to pursue an idea. My co-founder and I aimed to help
individual animators make traditional animation fast without
the need of a massive team (we made it to the semi-finals of a pitch competition!).
I used **Next.js**, **Redux**, and **MongoDB** to create an animation tool used by me
to make animations. These animations were posted on YouTube and
collected thousands of views.

My first internship, at the onset of the pandemic. I Joined the QA team and worked on
